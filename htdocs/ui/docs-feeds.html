<p>An "feed" for an organisation is generally one of the following:</p>

<ul class='bullet-list'>
<li>Events related to the organisation.</li>
<li>News items from and about the organisation (This does not include sites which provide an actual news service). eg. Vice Chancellor opens new building.</li>
<li>Notices from the organsiation. eg. Building 23 will be closed on May 4th for essential maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be other kinds of feed.</p>
<p>iCalendar data is probably not going to be news or notices, but please still mark it as <span class='opd-value'>events</span> for easy discovery.</p>

<h3>Prefixes</h3>

<p>The examples on this page require the following prefixes to be defined at the top of your OPD:</p>

<code class='block'>@prefix dcterms: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt;
@prefix oo:      &lt;http://purl.org/openorg/&gt;</code>


<h3>Example</h3>

<code class='block'>&lt;<span class='opd-var'>FEED-URL</span>&gt; a &lt;http://purl.org/xtypes/Document-<span class='opd-var'>FEED-TYPE</span>&gt;
    oo:organization &lt;<span class='opd-var'>ORG-URI</span>&gt; ;
    dcterms:subject &lt;http://purl.org/openorg/theme/<span class='opd-var'>THEME</span>&gt; ;
    dcterms:license &lt;<span class='opd-var'>http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/</span>&gt; .
</code>

<p><span class='opd-var'>FEED-TYPE</span> is one of: <span class='opd-value'>RSS</span> or <span class='opd-value'>Atom</span> or <span class='opd-value'>iCalendar</span></p>

<p><span class='opd-var'>THEME</span> is one of: <span class='opd-value'>news</span> or <span class='opd-value'>events</span> or <span class='opd-value'>notices</span></p>

<p>You can alter the license to use more restrictive licenses, but with feeds like this public domain is recommended. This doesn't mean that people won't credit you as the source of the data, but it removes the obligation for them to do so.</p>
